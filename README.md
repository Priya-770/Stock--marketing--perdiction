            Data Collection
            
1.API Access: 

Use financial data APIs like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or Quandl to fetch historical stock price data. For example, using yfinance library in Python to fetch data from Yahoo Finance.

2. Data Preprocessing

Cleaning Data: Handle missing values, adjust for stock splits or dividends if necessary.
Feature Engineering: Create additional features that might be useful for prediction, such as moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), etc.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize Data: Plot stock prices over time, distributions of returns, etc., to understand patterns and correlations.

4. Feature Selection
Identify which features are relevant for predicting stock prices. Techniques like correlation analysis, PCA (Principal Component Analysis), or domain knowledge can guide this process.

5. Model Selection
Choose an appropriate machine learning model for prediction. Common choices include:
Linear Regression: Simple and interpretable.
Decision Trees/Random Forests: Can capture nonlinear relationships and interactions.
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): Often perform well on structured/tabular data.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs): For sequential data like time series.

6. Model Training
Split your data into training and testing sets.
Train the chosen model on the training data. Use techniques like cross-validation to tune hyperparameters.

7. Model Evaluation
Evaluate your model on the testing data using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or others relevant to regression tasks.

8. Model Deployment
Once satisfied with the modelâ€™s performance, deploy it to make predictions on new data.
Monitor performance over time and retrain as needed.
